This tool is designed to gather useful information from compiled binary files.

The default usage is:
	strings.py [options] path_to_file

Flags can be set to specify certain types of data.

Options:
	-o filename -- this option specifies a file to write the output to, instead of stdout. Unlike stdout, this option does not add tabs before strings.
	-u -- parse URLs
	-d -- parse DLLs
	-i -- parse IP Addresses
	-p -- parse File Paths
	-k -- parse Registry Keys
	-f -- parse Files
	-h -- parse SHA1 hash
	-v -- checks the SHA1sum value against VirusTotal's database and prints the report. If -o is selected this isformation is saved in a second file VirusTotalReport-filename.


Make sure to create a file vtAPI.key with your API key on the first line to ensure it works properly.
